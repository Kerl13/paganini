Paganini's documentation
========================

`Paganini` is a lightweight python library for tuning multiparametric
combinatorial specifications.

Given a combinatorial specification, expressed using a domain-specific language closely resembling Flajolet and Sedgewick's *symbolic method*, Paganini gives its users some additional control over the distribution of structures constructed using the designed samplers.
