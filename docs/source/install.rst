Installation
============

`Paganini` is available as a `Python` package for both `Python2` and `Python3`.
However, we cannot guarantee the required decimal precision for `Python2`, as
the support for this version of Python drops in 2020, and as a consequence, some
of the packages that we use, are not anymore maintained.
We strongly recommend using `Python3`.

.. warning::
    We assume that the user is familiar with `Python` and its package manager
    `pip`. If you are new to `Python`, please visit the official installation
    webpage `<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. For new versions of `Python`,
    `pip` is already pre-installed. If you don't have it, check
    `<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_

Paganini is available as a `pip` package.

    >>> pip install paganini
